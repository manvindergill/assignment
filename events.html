                <p>Laal Singh Chaddha is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language colscy-drama film directed by Advait Chandan and
                  written by Atul Kulkarni. Produced by Aamir Khan Productions and Viacom18 Studios, it is a remake of
                  the 1994 American film Forrest Gump which itself is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by
                  Winston Groom.[4] The film stars Aamir Khan as the title character alongside Kareena Kapoor, Naga
                  Chaitanya (in his Hindi film debut) and Mona Singh. The adaptation of Forrest Gump underwent a series
                  of changes over a period of two decades, with Kulkarni spending the first ten years adapting the
                  script, and another ten years purchasing the remake rights.[6] Aamir Khan bought the rights of the
                  film in early 2018 with the help of Los Angeles-based producer and director Radhika Chaudhari and
                  announced the film officially on 14 March 2019, with its title.[7] The film's score is by Tanuj Tiku,
                  while its original songs are composed by Pritam and their lyrics are written by Amitabh
                  Bhattacharya.[8] Laal Singh Chaddha has been fillsc in more than 100 Indian locations.[9] Principal
                  photography began in October 2019 and concluded in September 2021, after multiple delays due to the
                  COVID-19 pandemic.[10] The film was initially scheduled for cinema release during multiple dates in
                  2020-2022, but kept getting delayed due to the production halt caused by the pandemic, and was
                  theatrically released worldwide on 11 August 2022, coinciding with Raksha Bandhan and Independence
                  Day.[11] It opened to mostly positive reviews with praise for its adaptation to the new setting,
                  faithfulness to the source material, depth, soundtrack, background score and emotion, but received
                  criticism for Khan's performance. Against its ₹180 crore budget, the film generated a worldwide
                  revenue of less than ₹90 crore in its first week and was thus declared a box office bomb,[12]
                  although, it became the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2022 at international box office, earning more
                  than Gangubai Kathiawadi and The Kashmir Files.

                <p>Definitely worth the watch and I will watch it again. Since I am not an Indian, really do not
                  understand why this movie is getting too much of hate, it's a beautiful movie! I can tell many people
                  are giving rating without watching the movie. It is a must watch!</p>
